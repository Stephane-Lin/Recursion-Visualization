Recursion-Visualization
=======================

Visual tracing program of a recursive method in java

This program allows the user to calculate and visualize the 
factorial of integers up to 20, step by step through the tracing 
of a simple recursive method in Java.

Integers less or equal than zero is assumed, for the sake of
simplicity, to have factorial of zero where no steps are shown
for the visualization part.
